# INTERNSHIP_DROOM
MY INTERNSHIP TEST

**Exercise 1: G2 Scraper**

I tried in two ways:
First:
**pycharm IDE**

 -I used three important libraries -BeautifulSoup v4, Pandas, and Selenium.
 -**BeautifulSoup** is widely used to parse the HTML files
  **Pandas** is used to create structured data
  **Selenium** provides browser automation
  
  I begined by defining our browser. Depending on the webdriver we picked back in “WebDriver and browsers”  I typed in:
  
**  driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='c:\path\to\windows\webdriver\executable.exe')
**

**Although I create a pythonfile in pycharm i was not able to collect the scraped data, I cannot pass through the web verification code.**

 Second:
 
**I tried with another code** 

**-I was detected by the website as a robot and again i could not pass through.**
 But provided the code:
